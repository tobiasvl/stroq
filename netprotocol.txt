StroQ MP
--------
StroQ 0.5 features a new multiplayer mode, where players face each other on
one on one versus matches through a dedicated server. The server handles user
accounts, games and chats.

The network protocol is based on TCP, and each message is preceded by a
2 bytes header indicating the size, in bytes, of the message that follows.

Out of game communication
-------------------------
Upon connecting, a player is added to the main chatroom. His options are then
to:

 - Ladder game
 - Free game
 - Chat in the room
 - Quit

Ladder games are matches set up by the server, it pits a player against
another player of similar ranking (if possible) who is also looking for a
ladder match.

Free games are no-reward games, played just for fun.
